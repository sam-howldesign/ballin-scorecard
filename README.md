# (Mark's) Golf Ballin' Scorecard

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project makes a web app that lets users keep track of golf scores for a variable number of players and holes played.

To run it you can clone it and then do `npm run start` and it will spin up a local webserver and show the app
If you do `npm run build` it will make a build directory with the files you need to serve it on a webpage.
